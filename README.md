# Repo for brycewray.com

This is the repository from which the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)-generated version of [brycewray.com](https://www.brycewray.com/) was built (the current repo is https://github.com/brycewray/eleventy_site). I suggest you use it **only for reference** and, rather than cloning or forking it, use one of the **starter sets** based on it (see below).

## Starter sets based on this repo

For a list of **starter sets** based on the design of the site that this repo builds, please see [this post on my website](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2021/03/beginners-luck-update).

**Note**: If you insist of cloning or forking **this** repo (rather than one of the starter sets) for your use, be sure to change the `_data/metadata.json` file to reflect **your** information rather than mine.
